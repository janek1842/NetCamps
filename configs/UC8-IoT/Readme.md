## Internet of Things configuration

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data. Essentially, IoT allows these devices to communicate and interact with each other over the internet, facilitating the seamless exchange of information and enabling users to remotely monitor and control these devices. 

> As a user, I want to use an efficient and intelligent IoT devices, to save energy and increase security in the network

In a campus network, the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) holds significant importance for several reasons. Firstly, IoT devices can enhance campus infrastructure by providing real-time monitoring and control of various systems such as lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), ensuring optimal energy efficiency and resource utilization.

## Demo
The list of below steps, present description of the IoT demo:
- **Alfa** dorm: movement inside the building automatically turns on light and fan saving energy and costs
- **Bet** dorm: entering dorm invokes turning on IoT camera and motion sensor alarm preventing security 
- **Gamma** dorm: wind movement causes shutting down windows and turning on fan preventing potential damage
